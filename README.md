## Disable Fullscreen Effects
Disables fullscreen effects like radial blur and bloom. This doesn't capture every such effect since some hardcoded into the animations.

Can be configured to toggle blur and bloom through the r2modman config editor.

## Installation

Use r2modman by ebkr from [Thunderstore](https://thunderstore.io/package/ebkr/r2modman/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/ebkr/r2modmanPlus/releases/latest).
